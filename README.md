# SampleData
Some sample data sets to play around with:

states.csv - 2020, 2010, and 2020 US Census state population data. Includes columns for percent change from prior decennial census, as well as state names, two-letter codes, US Census Region and US Census Division.

east_coast_states.csv - Subset of states.csv for use when making graphs that look best with fewer than 50 items.

BOS_temperatures.csv - File of Boston daily max and minimum temperatures as well as additional columns for daily "feels like" max, min and avg temps; [climo_high_f] NCEI 1991-2020 Daily High Temperature Climatology [F]; [climo_low_f] NCEI 1991-2020 Daily Low Temperature Climatology [F]; and month, year, day columns.
